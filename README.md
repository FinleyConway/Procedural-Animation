# ProcedualAnimations
 A project that I am doing for my final major project.

For my project, I am doing procedural animations which allows objects dynamically animate in any terrain it is placed in. This will allow me to do fluid movement and have each limb be placed correctly without any clipping or floating in mid air or any jerkiness which may occur while also trying to make the movement feel natural at the same time. This might be quite difficult to achieve since I will need to come up with a way to dynamically move the bones freely on any terrain during real time. However, I felt like just doing procedural animations by itself is quite a limiting on what it can do and I want to expand further from this and create some sort of enemy that could potentially be chasing the player making it very intense in a very rough environment to truly show the power and realism of what procedural animations can do. Furthermore, I can further show how procedural animations work by having the player have some form of procedural movement as well and let the player be able to move and climb anywhere so that the player doesn't feel like the odd one out when getting chased by the enemy.
